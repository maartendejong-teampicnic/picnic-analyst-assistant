# Picnic Analyst Assistant

A Claude Code framework for analyst work at Picnic Technologies. An orchestrator decomposes tasks across specialised agents — Analyst, Engineer, Writer, Presenter, Designer — each producing structured output the next agent builds on, from first analysis through final delivery.

---

## How it works

The system is built around a multi-agent pipeline coordinated by an **orchestrator**.

When you run `/perform`, the ORCHESTRATOR reads your task brief, decomposes it into phases, and routes each phase to the right specialist:

| Agent | Responsibilities |
|-------|-----------------|
| **ANALYST** | Snowflake queries, reporting sheets, ... |
| **ENGINEER** | DBT models, Github PRs, ... |
| **WRITER** | Slack messages, Confluence pages, ... |
| **PRESENTER** | Storylines, PowerPoint slides, ... |
| **DESIGNER** | Excalidraw diagrams, Figma sketches, ... |

Agents load the relevant **skill files** from `knowledge/` at startup and build on each other's outputs. Every irreversible action — sending a message, merging a PR, publishing a page — is surfaced to you for approval before it happens.

For focused, single-domain work you can invoke any agent directly: `/analyst`, `/writer`, `/engineer`, etc.

**Knowledge routing** is managed by `knowledge/INDEX.yaml`. Each entry defines which agents load a file and under what conditions. Adding a new skill means adding one `knowledge/<skill>.md` file — no agent definitions need editing.

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install

The repo must live at a fixed path — `~/CLAUDE.md` imports the orchestration rules from there.

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/Documents/Claude/picnic-analyst-assistant
cp ~/Documents/Claude/picnic-analyst-assistant/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
```

### 2. Run `/setup` in Claude Code

```
/setup
```

The setup guide walks you through everything: configuring your identity, verifying MCP connections (Snowflake, GitHub, Confluence, Slack), creating personal context files, and syncing shared skills. About 10 minutes total.

## Onboarding your knowledge

The knowledge onboarding step is what makes the assistant useful for your specific workflow. Without it, agents have no context about your tables, your coding conventions, your Slack style, or your experiment methodology.

Run `/onboard-knowledge` once per skill area:

```
/onboard-knowledge
```

It guides you through:

1. Describing the skill area (e.g. "Snowflake SQL conventions", "dbt model patterns", "Slack communication style")
2. A structured intake — you answer questions about your conventions
3. The system drafts a `knowledge/<skill>.md` file and registers it in `INDEX.yaml`
4. You review and approve before anything is written

The `knowledge/` folder ships with example files that show the expected format. Typical first skills to onboard: SQL conventions, dbt patterns, Slack style, experiment methodology.

To review or evolve the knowledge base and overall system structure, use `/architect`.

## Shared vs. personal

| What | Where | Shared |
|------|-------|--------|
| Agent logic, skill files, patterns | `agents/`, `knowledge/`, `patterns/` | ✅ |
| Picnic business vocabulary | `context/picnic-business.md` | ✅ |
| Your identity (name, prefix, email) | `user-config.md` | personal |
| Your task list | `TASKS.md` | personal |
| Your communication style | `context/communication-style.md` | personal |
| Your project context | `context/<project>.md` | personal |
| Task and direct output | `tasks/`, `direct/` | personal |

## Onboarding a colleague

1. Share the repo URL
2. They clone to `~/Documents/Claude/picnic-analyst-assistant` and copy the commands (step 1 above)
3. They run `/setup` in Claude Code — everything else is guided
