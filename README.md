# Picnic Analyst Assistant

A Claude Code framework that gives you a personal **Analyst Assistant** — a multi-agent system that knows your data, your conventions, and your communication style.

For setup and usage documentation, see the [Analyst Assistant Reference Handbook](https://picnic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Commercial/pages/6270025746).

## What it can do

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Run a one-off Snowflake query and explain the result | `/analyst` |
| Build a dbt model or create a GitHub PR | `/engineer` |
| Draft a Confluence page or Slack message | `/writer` |
| Run a full task end-to-end: query → PR → Slack update | `/perform` |
| Add or review tasks in your task list | `/tasks` |
| Teach the system your SQL conventions or Slack style | `/onboard-knowledge` |
| Add a new specialist agent to the system | `/add-agent` |
| Review the system or update its structure | `/architect` |

The more you invest in teaching the assistant your conventions, the higher the quality of its output.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code + VS Code** — [Claude Code installation guide](https://picnic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADP/pages/4627071060)
- **GitHub, Snowflake, and dev tooling** — [Developer security setup](https://picnic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVSEC/pages/5599363243)

---

## Installation

```bash
gh repo clone maartendejong-teampicnic/picnic-analyst-assistant ~/picnic-analyst-assistant
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands/ && cp ~/picnic-analyst-assistant/commands/setup.md ~/.claude/commands/
cd ~/picnic-analyst-assistant && code .
```

Then in the Claude Code panel: `/setup`

> Always open VS Code from `~/picnic-analyst-assistant/` — Claude Code loads the analyst context automatically from that folder's `CLAUDE.md`.

## File tiers

The repo uses a three-tier model — know which tier a file is in before editing it.

### Framework — do not edit
These files define how the system works. Edits here affect everyone who clones the repo.

| File / folder | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Orchestration rules, loaded automatically by Claude Code |
| `README.md` | This file |
| `CONTEXT.md` | Blank task context template used by the orchestrator |
| `user-config.md.example` | Identity template for new users |
| `.gitignore` | Allowlist that controls what is committed |
| `patterns/` | Setup, architect, and onboard-knowledge patterns |

### Working files — yours to customise
These are committed as starting points so you get them on `git clone`. After `/setup` runs,
they are marked skip-worktree — any edits you make stay local and will never be committed.

| File / folder | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `agents/` | Agent onboarding files — adapt prompts and rules to your workflow |
| `commands/` | Slash command definitions — add, rename, or remove commands |
| `knowledge/` | Skill files — extend INDEX.yaml and add your own via `/onboard-knowledge` |
| `tools/costs/` | Claude API cost tracking tool |

### Private — never committed
Created locally; gitignored.

| File / folder | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `user-config.md` | Your identity (name, email, username prefix, team) |
| `TASKS.md` | Your task list |
| `tasks-output/` | Per-task output folders |
| `direct-output/` | Direct-mode output folders |
| `context/` | Personal project context files (communication style, project notes, etc.) |

## Onboarding a colleague

1. Share this repo URL with them
2. They run the same installation steps above
3. They run `/setup` — it walks through all phases automatically:
   - Installs all commands into `~/.claude/commands/`
   - Writes their `user-config.md` (name, email, team)
   - Checks MCP connections (Snowflake, GitHub, Confluence)
   - Syncs shared skills from `picnic-analytical-tools`
4. Done — they can run `/perform` immediately

Each user's personal files (`user-config.md`, `TASKS.md`, task outputs, personal knowledge files) are gitignored and never shared — everyone gets their own private workspace on top of the shared framework.
